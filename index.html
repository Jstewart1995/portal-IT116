    <p> 
        I love to change the energy in a room from something less interesting into a pleasing and positive environment. Spark a light within an individual. I’m very dependable and love to find different ways of approaching situations for possible solutions. I have an extremely amount of patience, and I think that’s very important in this career, with all the testing and going through trial and error that we’re going to experience. 
    </p> 
    <p>
        During my remaining time here at Year up, I hope to increase my hard skills for programing. Continue to meet and make connections with my peers, but most importantly, I want to be better at taking upon a leader role.I want to comfortably make an impact for a larger purpose and be influential to the future of our kids. I am extremely grateful for this opportunity, and with the help and support of the staff and my peers, I’m going to make it happen and always google it!
    </p>
    <p>
        My group and I want to thank you for your time and attention. We hope you all enjoyed our presentation and learned a few new things about us and what we expect to gain throughout our time here together at Year Up. Does anyone have any questions for us today? If not, again we thank you all for joining us.
    </p>
